I have started 100 days challenge to learn something every day. I started with simple programming questions which are usually asked in interviews.<br>
After some time I have shifted towards Data Science. Now I am doing a course from the PadhAI platform and learning so many new things relate to data science.
Please refer to my LinkedIn for the daily updates.
